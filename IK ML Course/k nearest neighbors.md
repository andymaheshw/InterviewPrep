* can change distance from Euclidean to Manhattan to suit needs of problems
* Hamming distance for categorical inputs - why
* Good way to fill in values.
- **KNN** is classification (supervised task-- outcome = known class), whereas k-mean is clustering (unsupervised task-- outcome = unknown and possible relate group). K-means clustering represents an unsupervised algorithm, mainly used for clustering, while KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification.
